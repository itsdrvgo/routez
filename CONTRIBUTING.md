# CONTRIBUTING

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Feel free to add more features to the app. I could've added likes, comments, etc. but I wanted to keep it simple.

## Guidelines

-   Fork the repo and clone it locally.
-   Create a new branch for your feature.
-   **If you know how to add client-side rendering, do open a PR. 😉**
-   Make sure to add the environment variables in `.env` file.
-   Make sure to add the `.env` file in `.gitignore` file, if it's not already there.
-   Make sure to add new environment variables in `.env.example` and `env.mjs` files.
-   Push your changes to your forked repo.
-   Create a pull request to the `main` branch of this repo.
-   Make sure to add a description of your changes.
-   Optionally, you can add screenshots of your changes.
-   Make sure to add the `Closes #issue-number` in the description of your pull request, if it's related to any issue.
-   Make sure to add the `Fixes #issue-number` in the description of your pull request, if it fixes any issue.
